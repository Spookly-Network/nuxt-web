## Current Game Modes

### Minecraft Bingo
Dive into the classic and quick variants of Minecraft Bingo, where your strategic skills and survival instincts are put to the test. Each team is given a list of 9 items to collect, and at the start of the round, teams are teleported to random locations in the vast Minecraft world. The first team to gather all items wins. While the classic variant can last up to two hours, the quick variant offers a fast-paced 20-minute challenge for those seeking a shorter, yet equally intense experience.

### Jumpwars
Experience the adrenaline rush of Jumpwars, a unique combination of parkour and combat. Players must navigate through challenging jump-and-run modules to earn points. These points can then be spent on essential equipment such as weapons, armor, food, and potions. Once the buying phase concludes, players are teleported to a battleground where teams fight for supremacy. Each team has three lives, and the last team standing claims victory.
